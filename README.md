# Advent of Code 2021

steps to compile and run part `a` of each day's puzzle:
```
mlton a.mlb
./a < input
```

## dependencies

- [MLton](http://mlton.org/):
for compiling code
(I didn't check if my code compiles
with other implementations of Standard ML)

- [Smackage](https://github.com/standardml/smackage):
package manager for installing libraries

- [cmlib](https://github.com/standardml/cmlib):
basic data structures including dictionaries (maps) and sets
